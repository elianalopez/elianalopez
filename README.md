### Hi there 👋

I am a dedicated Software Engineer with over 3 years of experience. I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Mathematics and recently obtained a Master's of Science in Computer Science. My career has been focused on developing robust and high-performance software applications.

With a strong foundation in software engineering and mathematics, I am proficient in designing and implementing complex algorithms, optimizing performance, and deploying applications in dynamic environments. As a proactive learner, I am constantly exploring new technologies and methodologies to enhance my skill set.

### Featured Works ✔️

* **Instapup - The Instagram Puppy Generator** 📷🐶 | <a href = "https://github.com/elianalopez/Instapup"> GitHub</a> 
  * Utilized the **Beautiful Soup** library to continuously webscrape photos of dogs from Google Images every 300 seconds
  * Utilized the **instabot** library to connect and randomly choose a photo of a dog to upload
  * Created a cleaner function to remove photos that were chosen by the instabot every 300 seconds

* **Raspi Car Project** 🍓🏎️ | <a href = "https://github.com/elianalopez/RaspiCar-Project"> GitHub</a> 
  * Redesigned an RC Car toy car with the Raspberry Pi  and a Motor Drive Board Module to control motors via a Python program
  * Launched a webserver user interface that controls the car motors and live streams the PiCam with the Python **Flask** library 
  * Integrated languages such as Python 3.0, HTML, CSS, and Raspberry Pi for this project 

### Writing 📝

### Hi there 👋

My name is Eliana Lopez and in undergrad I majored in mathematics and a double minor in economics and computer science, however I enjoy the mathematical applications behind programming! I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at Georgia Tech while working full-time as a software engineer. 

### Currently Working On 🚀

* **Data Structures Study Guide in Python** 📝 | <a href = "https://github.com/elianalopez/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Notes-with-Python"> GitHub</a>

* **Web Scrapping Projects with Python** 📜⛏️| <a href = "https://github.com/elianalopez/Web-Scraping-Projects-with-Python"> GitHub</a>
