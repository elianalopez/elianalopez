### Hi there 👋

My name is Eliana Lopez and I am a student studying mathematics, however I enjoy the mathematical applications behind programming!

### Currently Working On 🚀

* Data Structures Study Guide in Python 📝 | <a href = "https://github.com/elianalopez/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Notes-with-Python"> GitHub</a>

* Website Portfolio 💻

* Web Scrapping Projects with Python 📜⛏️| <a href = "https://github.com/elianalopez/Web-Scraping-Projects-with-Python"> GitHub</a>

* *secret* 🤫

### Finished Works ✔️

* **Raspi Car Project** 🍓🏎️ | <a href = "https://github.com/elianalopez/RaspiCar-Project"> GitHub</a> 
  * Redesigned an RC Car toy car with the Raspberry Pi  and a Motor Drive Board Module to control motors via a Python program
  * Launched a webserver user interface that controls the car motors and live streams the PiCam with the Python Flask library 
  * Integrated languages such as Python 3.0, HTML, CSS, and Raspberry Pi for this project 

* **Instapup - The Instagram Puppy Generator** 📷🐶 | <a href = "https://github.com/elianalopez/Instapup"> GitHub</a> 
  * Utilized the **Beautiful Soup** library to continuosly webscrapes photos of dogs from Google Images every 300 seconds
  * Utilized the **instabot** library to connect and randomly choose a photo of a dog to upload
  * Created a cleaner function to remove photos that were choosen by the instabot every 300 seconds

* **Markov Chain Text Generator** 📷🐶 | <a href = "https://github.com/elianalopez/Markov-Chains-Text-Generator"> GitHub</a> 
  * Designed a random text generator that reads a given text-file and shuffles words by mimicking a Markov Chain Algorithm
  * Formatted the first word in the phrase to always be capitalized and the last structure to end with punctuation.
  * Implemented a speaking function for the randomly generated text after each shuffled phrase
  
* **Programming Languages Java Repository** ☕ | <a href = "https://github.com/elianalopez/Java"> GitHub</a> 
  * A Semester long Repository on the Java Programming Language
  * **<a href = "https://github.com/elianalopez/Java#final-project--java-tic-tac-toe">Final Project</a>** is a tic-tac-toe game that functions in the command line
  
    **The game had the following features:**
    * Multiple Game Modes (Single Player, Two Player, Spectator)
    * Instructions screen is an option within the title screen
    * Players were given custom names
    * Keep track of previous winners based off given names
    * Wins and Ties were part of the functionality of the tic-tac-toe game
